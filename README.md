I have created a responsive social media app named InstaShare. I used MongoDB, Express, Node, React, and GraphQL (the MERNG stack).
I implemented a GraphQL server that uses Node and Express to communicate to a MongoDB Database and fetch and persist data to the websites back-end.

I used the heroku server to deploy the back-end. I used a custom domain I made and Netlify to deploy the client side.
