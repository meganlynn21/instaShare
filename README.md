I have created a responsive social media app named InstaShare. I used MongoDB, Express, Node, React, GraphQL, and Node (the MERNG stack).
I implemented a GraphQL server that uses Node and Express to communicate to a MongoDB Database and fetch and persist data to the websites back-end.

I used the heroku server to deploy the back-end. I used a custom domain I made and Netlify to deploy the client side.

Make a post and try it out! Once you have registered an account and are logged in, you can create posts, like posts, and comment on posts. You can also delete your own comments and delete your posts.
