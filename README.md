I have created a social media app named InstaShare. I used MongoDB, Express, Node, React, GraphQL, and Node (the MERNG stack).
I implemented a GraphQL server that uses Node and Express to communicate to a MongoDB Database and fetch and persist data to the websites back-end.

I am still working on making this responsive on mobile but it looks fine on desktop.

I did buy a domain to host it on since I plan on updating it more and adding things to it. But it is not ready yet because I am waiting for the SSL certificate to be verified. I used the heroku server to deploy the back-end and I used Netlify to deploy the client side
